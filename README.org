* Org Mode Bookmarks Extractor
This tool can extract web bookmarks from org-mode files into html files which you can import into web browsers.

** Why?
I always use an org-mode file to manage all my bookmarks. There are several advantages:

- All bookmarks in one place. No conflict between different browsers.
- Easy to edit. If you use browser to manage bookmarks, it is not so convenient to change bookmarks hierarchy, or rearrange them. You have to do a lot of mouse clicking.

But there is a disadvantage, everytime I want to access a bookmark I have to open the org-mode file. What if I can open it directly in my browser? So I made this tool to extract bookmarks from org-mode file into html file, then import it into every browser.

** Usage
Just open your bookmark org-mode file and ~M-x org-bookmarks-extractor-extract~. It will create a html file in the same directory.
