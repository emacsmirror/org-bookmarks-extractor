* Org Mode Bookmarks Extractor
This tool can extract web bookmarks from org-mode files into html files which you can import into web browsers.

** Why?
I always use an org-mode file to manage all my bookmarks. There are several advantages:

- All bookmarks in one place. No conflict between different browsers.
- Easy to edit. If you use browser to manage bookmarks, it is not so convenient to change bookmarks hierarchy, or rearrange them. You have to do a lot of mouse clicking.

** Usage
